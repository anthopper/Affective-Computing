Mar  0:04  
I am I'm videoing myself

Mar  0:07  
having consented to this.

Kit Martin  0:09  
Do you need any coffee?

Mar  0:11  
No. I have coffee.

Kit Martin  0:14  
Great. How are you feeling today? Great.

Kit Martin  0:18  
Can you do the facial expression that most best approximates that feeling?

Mar  0:23  
"No, no, this is it. Okay."

Kit Martin  0:29  
Have you ever noticed anything about

Mar  0:33  
it? Yeah.

Mar  0:37  
"And they walk around and sometimes they appear in big groups walking around and sometimes they carry things from place to place. Like food stuff and, and house, house building materials."

Kit Martin  0:56  
How to ants collect food and then

Mar  1:02  
Lift did with their tiny feet above their heads where they then carry it.

Kit Martin  1:13  
Sir answer collecting food and doing house repairs and such how to ants know what to do.

Mar  1:20  
"Um, because they followed an older and and oh, maybe and also they're pre programmed genetically."

Mar  1:37  
"Dude, dude"

Mar  1:41  
"um yeah. So I'm I'm guessing without knowing this, that they're somewhat evolved to collect food in a certain way and possibly also learn socially from one another For example, how to find the food source in their territory. I do not know this whatsoever."

Kit Martin  2:11  
"Okay, so, with so many ants in the colony, how do ants protect public health of the colony?"

Mar  2:22  
"Um, it depends on the end type."

Kit Martin  2:28  
"Okay, such as"

Mar  2:31  
"and that sting and stingless ands, I know that these exist. Mm hmm. And the ones that Sting, Sting, they're predators, and the ones that don't escape or hide."

Kit Martin  2:48  
That make sense. So but imagine there's like an ant disease. Mm hmm. And one gets infected. And it's going into the colony. How do you think the ants protect themselves? From

Mar  3:05  
just

Mar  3:07  
feel like this one was the setup I

Mar  3:13  
have never thought about this until this moment

Mar  3:18  
and um

Mar  3:26  
um I don't do some ants kill a sick and and carry it far far away and then never speak of it again

Kit Martin  3:39  
like hide the dirty secret

Mar  3:43  
yeah

Mar  3:45  
or maybe they're defenseless and there just aren't a lot of ant diseases or there are always some ants running around that if they return unless either city coughing they run far far away and start their own and Hill

Mar  4:07  
study.

Kit Martin  4:08  
Those all seem like perfectly reasonable hypotheses I think we could like look at ants and get some data to go on that that makes sense. So again with so many ants like climbing inside they're confined in these tunnels. How do you deal with traffic congestion?

Mar  4:30  
build bigger tunnels.

Mar  4:36  
Try to find around each other.

Mar  4:40  
Meditate patiently.

Mar  4:47  
"find other ways to get from A to B. Or maybe take the offending and bring it far, far away barrier. never speak of it again."

Kit Martin  5:00  
You mentioned build bigger tunnels How would that work?

Mar  5:03  
They would take their

Mar  5:07  
little tunnel building devices that are attached

Mar  5:13  
to their faces.

Mar  5:15  
"Well we go the move left and right to shovel soil away, loosen it and then give it to another and that might carry it away or just put it on their backs and carry it out of the tunnel system. Truly I do not know"

Kit Martin  5:37  
we're trying to get a get the best guesses you know nothing about it has nothing to do with you know any answer. These are not school questions there. I forgot to mention there are no right answers. You're not supposed to know any of this. Hmm. So how do you think an ants size would affect an ants life?

Mar  6:12  
I think and and that is relative to its immediate peers probably lives a long and healthy life compared to its peers.

Mar  6:27  
Large relative to its immediate peers.

Kit Martin  6:31  
Big ants live better.

Mar  6:33  
"Yeah, because probably they're eating well. How tall humans don't live as long as short humans. But a I'm not sure this is true and b i just think the lifespan of an ant is not long enough for like blood supply to become an issue. So probably eating well and plenty would be good."

Kit Martin  6:56  
Have you ever heard of pheromone trails

Mar  7:04  
No.

Kit Martin  7:10  
Have you ever seen ants walking lines?

Mar  7:14  
"Yep. And as soon as you said the term and made sense to me, but I hadn't previously heard that term."

Kit Martin  7:19  
Okay. Do you know why ants

Mar  7:21  
"walk in lines? Yes, because they follow the pheromone trail laid by the ants in front of them."

Kit Martin  7:30  
That makes sense. Mm hmm.

Kit Martin  7:34  
"Okay, I need to stop this thing from recording all of my slack messages. Oh, wow. So now we're going to thank you for that pre interview. Very good guesses about how things work. Now we're going to go look at a series of models."

Kit Martin  7:55  
You can go to kit see Martin calm

Kit Martin  8:11  
Go to recent projects and adaptation

Mar  8:22  
"wait and hopper top services portfolio publications, social media"

Mar  8:29  
and then catch him.

Mar  8:47  
"Okay, complex"

Kit Martin  8:50  
"beta test but what I'm trying to accomplish is give you first kind of an introduction to an introduction to like And based modeling and then I'm going then I'm trying to show you the model that I really want you to play with, which is like two colonies fighting with each other. The little small models as soon as you understand how it works, we can skip if you want, or you can go through each of them in sequence. kind of depends on time. I think we've gone time. So I think we can go through them all. But now we need to start your screen sharing so I can see what you're doing."

Mar  9:26  
"Okay, do I share my screen with you?"

Kit Martin  9:29  
"Yeah, you share your screen with me."

Kit Martin  9:36  
It's so exciting. The technology is working.

Mar  9:40  
We'll see.

Kit Martin  9:42  
We'll see.

Unknown Speaker  9:43  
Okay. Okay.

Mar  10:00  
"Alright, so is this big enough I have a similar screen also, but I could fullscreen this."

Kit Martin  10:07  
Now this is this is going great. The first step is read that introductory text.

Mar  10:20  
"I assume I'm writing this quietly. Yeah, that's good because I don't know how to pronounce the word that starts with murmur."

Mar  10:28  
Perfect. That's

Kit Martin  10:29  
exactly it.

Kit Martin  10:31  
If you're from Alabama

Mar  11:51  
I'm almost done Am I like memorizing as much as possible of this or just reading this for general

Kit Martin  11:56  
atmosphere imagine this like the introduction to start You don't have to remember a damn thing.

Mar  12:01  
"Great, great. Different test. Okay."

Mar  12:12  
"Um,"

Mar  12:12  
"yep, yeah, got it. Okay."

Kit Martin  12:15  
All right. Then the next step is you open introduction model.

Kit Martin  12:20  
Pro that blue button

Kit Martin  12:28  
and we hope this technology works because that would be super sad of it then.

Kit Martin  12:46  
Andrew situation going

Mar  12:49  
good. I had the best thing I did.

Mar  12:53  
"This weekend was to go on a bike ride to the Skokie lagoons for 35 miles and get out of the house. Snap out of it. Like there are no other cases at the nursing home. So it's it was mostly getting over the anxiety and then just waiting until it hopefully it doesn't happen again anytime soon, but probably will happen again eventually. Um, so I've been like the last What was it like 10 days or so before that were garbage. But after we had waited out the two week period, I felt pretty confident that we don't have it here. And it makes it a little bit nicer to have a little headache and not immediately think it is more than just a headache. And then on Saturday, I got on my bike and biked for many hours and got my first real exercise of the year aside from a one yoga class that I took in Wicker Park. In January kit This screen is not working, what do we do? Do we switch to my phone which can do everything and somehow figure out a way from my webcam to record Um, me after? Oh,"

Mar  14:09  
you have muted yourself.

Kit Martin  14:13  
I said what's not working? It's just not working on your browser.

Mar  14:16  
"Oh, do you mean you seen this screen? Right?"

Kit Martin  14:19  
"Yeah, that's just what's happening. Yeah."

Kit Martin  14:22  
Let me test it to see if it has failed on my end.

Kit Martin  14:32  
"Unfortunately, it loads on my end. So now what browser using"

Mar  14:41  
Firefox and I also have a Chrome browser. Should I try it in there? Should

Mar  14:48  
I have a Chrome browser? Should I try that one?

Kit Martin  14:50  
"Yeah, sure."

Kit Martin  14:55  
Is your download speed pretty decent these days.

Mar  15:01  
"Yeah, is there a button that I could use to find out what my download speed is? We did just get like an O Wi Fi booster in this exact room mm."

Mar  15:14  
Okay Kit Martin calm no kit

Mar  15:19  
no that was your was your website again?

Mar  15:27  
Oh you froze

Mar  15:30  
I can figure this out on my own hold on Kit netcom

Mar  15:43
